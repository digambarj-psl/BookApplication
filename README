useState` and `useEffect`, while data fetching is done using Axios. Navigation between different views is facilitated by React Router. 
 
- **Backend**: The backend is built on Node.js and Express.js, offering a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations. It includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, with Mongoose used for database interactions. CORS is enabled to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend. 
 
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database, hosted locally. Mongoose is employed to define schemas and manage data validation, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
 
The project structure includes a backend directory containing server setup and a frontend directory with the main React application components. 
 
## Features 
 
- **Create**: Users can add new entries with validation to prevent duplicates and handle invalid data. 
- **Read**: View a paginated list of entries, with search functionality for efficient data retrieval. 
- **Update**: Modify existing entries with support for partial updates. 
- **Delete**: Remove entries with a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions. 
- **User Interface**: Intuitive and dynamic interface with React.js components and routing.
